        <h2 class="title">Kwanzaa</h2>
        <p class="Weasel">Kwanzaa, a weeklong celebration of community and African culture, began with African Americans in the United States. Known for its
seven principles of unity (umoja), collective work and responsibility (ujima), cooperative economics (ujamaa), self-determination (kujichagulia),
purpose (nia), creativity (kuumba), and faith (imani), the holiday also places special significance on children.

Because children are the future of the community, they’re honored during Kwanzaa with gifts and encouraged to take important roles in celebrations.
They even helped give the holiday its name—Kwanzaa’s founders added an extra a to the Kiswahili word kwanza because seven children were involved
in the celebration’s early years!</p>

    <h2 class="title">Winter Solstice</h2>
    <p class="">Winter Solstice is an ancient tradition — possibly dating as far back as the Stone Age — that observes the shortest day of the year.
This occurs a few days before Christmas, and even though it’s celebrated in different forms everywhere from Sweden to Iran, England's
Stonehenge is thought to be one of the earliest epicenters for marking the longest night of the year due to the placement of the stones.
In fact, the Winter Solstice is still celebrated at Stonehenge, and anyone can buy tickets to experience the sunrise, along with Druid
and Pagan traditions.</p>

<div class="Fun Time">
    <h2 class="title">Diwali</h2>
    <p class="Weasel">Hindus celebrate Diwali, a major five-day festival of lights that’s observed in fall (the date is different every year).
The ancient holiday, found in Sanskrit texts, celebrates good over evil and light over darkness. As such, the holiday is filled with all manner of light,
from candles to firecrackers. Other traditions involve honoring the Hindu deity Lakshmi, who represents wealth, and creating rangoli, elaborate colorful
patterns made with paint, flowers, chalk, rice, sand and more. Gift giving is another huge part of the holiday (particularly anything gold), as are endless feasts.
Sweets are also key, like gulab jamun
